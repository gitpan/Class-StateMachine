        leaking into the environment used to evaluate state names from
        OnState declarations

0.22  Mar 25, 2013
      - add support for the set_state_isa and state_isa methods
      - improve detection of state changes from callbacks
        (i.e. enter_state, leave_state, delayed events, etc.)

        triggers callbacks

      - lots of improvements, some of them breaking backwards
        compatibility
      - use mro for better and saner method dispatching
      - move methods to __methods__ namespaces on demand
      - no CHECK blocks
      - require using Class::StateMachine::bless for object
        construction
      - much better docs
      - check_state callback
      - enter_state and leave_state callback
      - rebless renamed to bless
      - use FieldHash to store object state
      - use Sub::Name to rename subs into final namespace (ensuring
        next::method works as expected)
